# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got Redux Sagas working for adding a new item to a wishlist, and wrote my own hook (using react-use) to refresh the wishlist when an item is added.

**Thoughts:** Redux is making more and more sense to me the more I work with it.  Go figure!
